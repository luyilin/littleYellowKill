        <h2>Sheldon 座位理论</h2>
        <p>In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer it's directly in the path of a cross breeze created by opening windows there, and there.
            It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation,
            nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion. I could go on,
            but ... I think I've made my point.</p>
        <p>冬季的时候，这个地方离电暖器很近、最暖和，但是又不会近到让你感觉热、流汗；夏天的时候，这里又可以吹由那两扇窗户吹进来的徐徐微风；
            坐这的角度可以让我同时看电视又同时和他人聊天而不受影响，恰好不会太远也不会产生视觉上的错觉。</p>
        <p>That is my spot. In an ever-changing world it is a simple point of consistency.
            If my life were expressed as a function in a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system,
            that spot, at the moment I first sat on it, would be 0000.</p>
        <p>那是我的专座。在这个不断变化的世界里，这是不变的一点。假设我的生命用一个建立在四维直角坐标系里的方程来表示的话，
            这个座位从我坐上那一刻开始就成为了(0,0,0,0)。</p>
